# TimestampAnalyser
Analyses the time-stamps in an NTFS MFT to reverse-engineer what could have happened at those times.

This repository has been made public recently (2023-03-16) and I have not yet found the time to write an in-depth readme.

My thesis does provide some documentation on the tool: https://www.open.ou.nl/hjo/supervision/2019-jelle.bouma-bsc-thesis.pdf

Furthermore, any questions can be asked in the Issues section or in an e-mail to me.
